# Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard

This project simulates a **consulting-style engagement** where the goal is to help a client identify inefficiencies in their supply chain using **Python** and **SQL**.

## 🚀 Project Goals
- Create a database of orders, shipments, and inventory.
- Use **SQL** to calculate supply chain KPIs:
  - Inventory turnover
  - Fill rate
  - Average lead time
- Build **Python scripts** to analyze demand trends and forecast future needs.
- Visualize the results in an interactive dashboard (Streamlit).

## 📊 Example Business Case
A logistics client is struggling with delayed shipments and high inventory costs.  
This project shows how analytics can:
- Identify bottlenecks
- Recommend process improvements
- Quantify cost savings

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **SQL (SQLite/PostgreSQL)** → for querying KPIs
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly)** → for data cleaning & visualization
- **Streamlit** → for the dashboard
- **Jupyter Notebooks** → for documenting analysis

## 📂 Project Layout
- `data/` → sample datasets
- `sql/` → SQL queries for KPIs
- `notebooks/analysis.ipynb` → step-by-step Python analysis
- `app.py` → Streamlit dashboard
- `README.md` → project overview (this file)

## 🗓️ Timeline
- Week 1: Load dataset, run SQL KPIs (✅ complete)
- Month 1: Python analysis of KPIs & demand forecasting
- Month 2: Build Streamlit dashboard
- Month 3–4: Polish, add more datasets, refine presentation

## ✅ Current Status
✔️ Database created and connected  
✔️ SQL queries running for KPIs  
🔄 Expanding into Python analysis (in progress)
